# Converting to arrays (and back?)
# -------------------------------

h = {'a'=>1, 'b'=>2, 'c'=>3}

h.to_a

# How could you convert the result back into a hash?

# Challenge:
keys = ['one', 'two', 'three']
values = [1, 2, 3]
# Can you combine these two arrays into a Hash?
# (you might want to take another look at ruby3/array_ops.rb)
